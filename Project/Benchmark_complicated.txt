After all that happened, I can't imagine my life any other way.
I feel like if I dont stop and be thankful for them now, I will blink and they'll just be a memory.
I used an empathetic voice toned statement when I said "you feel scared because he threatened you".
I remember feeling depressed in college when I learned of so many ways in which I was far from perfect.
I feel like im really making progress and I am determined to not let things get so out of control again.
I feel summer coming and catch a glimpse of a gorgeous maxi dress or a beach skirt and I have to run away literally.
I kinda feel like I didn't get the chance to just be angry and hurt about what was being said about myself and her.
I dont mind it so much when im painting because then I feel artistic if I look in the mirror and see a color on me but grease.
I feel it is vital to engage with patients at every opportunity on what good nutrition looks like and dispel some of the myths.
I was feeling a little annoyed about the whole thing, because we had a schedule, and driving home first was going to really put a kink in it.
I'm feeling slightly out of the loop, so i broke down, decided not to wait months to get a copy from the library and slapped down a gift card.
I was different than my dormmates and while they sometimes tried to include me in the fun, I had the distinct feeling that my train of thought was unwelcome and that I was very different from everyone else there which led to a feeling of frustration at being unable to express myself.
